Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="gaussrender-learning-3d-occupancy-with-gaussian-rendering">GaussRender: Learning 3D Occupancy with Gaussian Rendering</h3> <h5 id="authors-loïck-chambon-éloi-zablocki-alexandre-boulch-mickaël-chen-matthieu-cord">Authors: <a href="https://loickch.github.io/">Loïck Chambon</a>, <a href="https://eloiz.github.io">Éloi Zablocki</a>, <a href="https://boulch.eu/">Alexandre Boulch</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QnRpMJAAAAAJ">Mickaël Chen</a>, <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a></h5> <h5 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05040">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/valeoai/GaussRender">Code</a>] </h5> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2025_gaussrender/teaser.png" alt="gaussrender_teaser" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <p>Understanding the 3D geometry and semantics of driving scenes is critical for safe autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D occupancy prediction improve scene representation but often suffer from spatial inconsistencies, leading to floating artifacts and poor surface localization. Existing voxel-wise losses (e.g., cross-entropy) fail to enforce geometric coherence. GaussRender is a module that improves 3D occupancy learning by enforcing projective consistency. The key idea is to project both predicted and ground-truth 3D occupancy into 2D camera views for supervision, penalizing inconsistent 3D configurations and enforcing coherent 3D structure. To achieve this efficiently, GaussRender leverages differentiable rendering with Gaussian splatting. It integrates seamlessly with existing architectures, requires no inference-time modifications, and significantly improves geometric fidelity across multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) and 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies).</p> <hr/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="padding-right: 5px;padding-left: 5px;"> <img src="../../assets/img/publications/2025_gaussrender/demo_scene_0003.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> <div class="caption"> Scene visualization 1 </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="padding-right: 5px;padding-left: 5px;"> <img src="../../assets/img/publications/2025_gaussrender/demo_scene_0013.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> <div class="caption"> Scene visualization 2 </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> GaussRender is a 3D Occupancy module that can be plugged into any 3D Occupancy model to enhance its predictions and ensure 2D-3D consistency while improving mIoU, IoU, and RayIoU. </div> <hr/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="../../assets/img/publications/2025_gaussrender/pipeline.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> <div class="caption"> GaussRender can be plugged into any model.

Existing approaches struggle under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. In this work, we introduce MoSiC, a motion-guided self-supervised framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. Using an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering with a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. Temporal coherence is enforced by propagating cluster assignments along tracked points, ensuring feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. By leveraging motion as an implicit supervisory signal and initializing from strong image-pretrained models, MoSiC learns robust representations that generalize across frames. Our approach improves state-of-the-art performance by 1% to 6% across six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="floss-free-lunch-in-open-vocabulary-semantic-segmentation">FLOSS: Free Lunch in Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</h3> <h5 id="authors-yasser-benigmim-mohammad-fahes-tuan-hung-vu-andrei-bursuc-raoul-de-charette">Authors: <a href="https://yasserben.github.io/">Yasser Benigmim</a>, <a href="https://mfahes.github.io/">Mohammad Fahes</a>, <a href="https://tuanhungvu.github.io/">Tuan-Hung Vu</a>, <a href="https://abursuc.github.io/">Andrei Bursuc</a>, <a href="https://team.inria.fr/rits/membres/raoul-de-charette/">Raoul de Charette</a></h5> <h5 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS">Code</a>] </h5> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2025_floss.jpg" alt="floss_teaser" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <p>In Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), class-wise text embeddings are usually averaged over multiple templates (e.g., “a photo of <class>", "a sketch of <class>") to form classifiers. We show that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers—termed class-experts—that outperform conventional averaged classifiers. To identify these class-experts without labeled data, we leverage class-wise prediction entropy and select the lowest-entropy classifiers as the most reliable. We then fuse the outputs of these class-experts using a novel plug-and-play process called FLOSS. FLOSS is complementary to existing OVSS methods, requiring no additional labels or training, yet consistently improves performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLOSS enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes across datasets with distribution shifts, and yields strong improvements in low-data scenarios with only a few unlabeled images.</class></class></p> <hr/> <h3 id="analyzing-fine-tuning-representation-shift-for-multimodal-llms-steering-alignment">Analyzing Fine-tuning Representation Shift for Multimodal LLMs Steering Alignment</h3> <h5 id="authors-pegah-khayatan-mustafa-shukor-jayneel-parekh-matthieu-cord">Authors: <a href="https://pegah-kh.github.io/">Pegah Khayatan</a>, <a href="https://mustafashukor.github.io/">Mustafa Shukor</a>, <a href="https://jayneelparekh.github.io/">Jayneel Parekh</a>, <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a></h5> <h5 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03012">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/mshukor/xl-vlms/">Code</a>] </h5> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2025_xlxvlm.png" alt="xlvlm_teaser" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <p>Multimodal LLMs have achieved remarkable proficiency in understanding multimodal inputs, yet little attention has been given to explaining how their internal representations evolve during training. Most explainability research focuses only on final model states, ignoring dynamic representational shifts. In this work, we systematically analyze the evolution of hidden state representations during fine-tuning, revealing how models adapt to new multimodal tasks. Using a concept-based approach, we map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts, enabling us to trace concept changes across modalities as training progresses. We introduce shift vectors to capture these changes, allowing recovery of fine-tuned concepts from the original model. Furthermore, we demonstrate practical applications in model steering, such as adjusting answer types, caption styles, or biasing responses without additional training.

Fine-tuning usually requires “white-box” access to the model’s architecture and weights, which is not always feasible due to proprietary or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a method for “black-box” adaptation of VLMs for the REC task using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLM-wrapper capitalizes on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, improved with a light fine-tuning, to select the most relevant bounding box matching the referring expression, from candidates generated by a zero-shot black-box VLM. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the adaptation of closed-source models without needing access to their internal workings, it is versatile as it works with any VLM, it transfers to new VLMs and datasets, and it allows for the adaptation of an ensemble of VLMs. We evaluate LLM-wrapper on multiple datasets using different VLMs and LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements and highlighting the versatility of our method. While LLM-wrapper is not meant to directly compete with standard white-box fine-tuning, it offers a practical and effective alternative for black-box VLM adaptation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_llm_wrapper/llm_wrapper_talk2car.png" alt="llm_wrapper_results" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="moca-self-supervised-representation-learning-by-predicting-masked-online-codebook-assignments">MOCA: Self-supervised Representation Learning by Predicting Masked Online Codebook Assignments</h2> <h3 id="authors-spyros-gidaris-andrei-bursuc--oriane-siméoni--antonin-vobecky--nikos-komodakis--matthieu-cord--patrick-pérez">Authors: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7atfg7EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Spyros Gidaris</a>   <a href="https://abursuc.github.io/">Andrei Bursuc</a>   <a href="https://osimeoni.github.io/">Oriane Siméoni</a>    <a href="https://vobecant.github.io/">Antonin Vobecky</a>    <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~komod/">Nikos Komodakis</a>    <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a>    <a href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/">Patrick Pérez</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15297">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/valeoai/MOCA">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/moca/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_moca/moca-teaser.png" alt="moca_teaser" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <p>Self-supervised learning can be used for mitigating the greedy needs of Vision Transformer networks for very large fully-annotated datasets. Different classes of self-supervised learning offer representations with either good contextual reasoning properties, e.g., using masked image modeling strategies, or invariance to image perturbations, e.g., with contrastive methods. In this work, we propose a single-stage and standalone method, MOCA, which unifies both desired properties using novel mask-and-predict objectives defined with high-level features (instead of pixel-level details). Moreover, we show how to effectively employ both learning paradigms in a synergistic and computation-efficient way. Doing so, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on low-shot settings and strong experimental results in various evaluation protocols with a training that is at least 3 times faster than prior methods.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="learning-a-neural-solver-for-parametric-pdes-to-enhance-physics-informed-methods">Learning a Neural Solver for Parametric PDEs to Enhance Physics-Informed Methods</h2> <h3 id="authors-lise-le-boudec--emmanuel-de-bezenac--louis-serrano--ramon-daniel-regueiro-espino--yuan-yin--patrick-gallinari">Authors: <a href="https://2ailesb.github.io/">Lise Le Boudec</a>    <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KvZw5gYAAAAJ">Emmanuel de Bezenac</a>    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fKlo-lUAAAAJ">Louis Serrano</a>    <a href="https://rd-regueiroespino.github.io/">Ramon Daniel Regueiro-Espino</a>    <a href="https://yuan-yin.github.io">Yuan Yin</a>    <a href="https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/">Patrick Gallinari</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06820">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/2ailesB/neural-parametric-solver">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/neural-parametric-solver/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2025_neural_parametric_solver.png" alt="neural_solver_pde" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <p>Physics-informed deep learning often faces optimization challenges due to the complexity of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve exploring large solution spaces, require numerous iterations, and can lead to unstable training. These challenges arise particularly from the ill-conditioning of the optimization problem, caused by the differential terms in the loss function. To address these issues, we propose learning a solver, i.e., solving PDEs using a physics-informed iterative algorithm trained on data. Our method learns to condition a gradient descent algorithm that automatically adapts to each PDE instance, significantly accelerating and stabilizing the optimization process and enabling faster convergence of physics-aware models. Furthermore, while traditional physics-informed methods solve for a single PDE instance, our approach addresses parametric PDEs. Specifically, our method integrates the physical loss gradient with the PDE parameters to solve over a distribution of PDE parameters, including coefficients, initial conditions, or boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through empirical experiments on multiple datasets, comparing training and test-time optimization performance.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="toddlerdiffusion-interactive-structured-image-generation-with-cascaded-schrödinger-bridge">ToddlerDiffusion: Interactive Structured Image Generation with Cascaded Schrödinger Bridge</h2> <h3 id="authors-eslam-abdelrahman--liangbing-zhao--vincent-tao-hu--matthieu-cord--patrick-perez--mohamed-elhoseiny">Authors: Eslam Abdelrahman    Liangbing Zhao    Vincent Tao Hu    <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a>    <a href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/">Patrick Perez</a>    Mohamed Elhoseiny</h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14542">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/toddlerdiffusion/code">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://toddlerdiffusion.github.io/website/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2025_toddler.PNG" alt="toddlerdiffusion" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <p>Diffusion models break down the challenging task of generating data from high-dimensional distributions into a series of easier denoising steps. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose a novel approach that extends the diffusion framework into modality space, decomposing the complex task of RGB image generation into simpler, interpretable stages. Our method, termed ToddlerDiffusion, cascades modality-specific models, each responsible for generating an intermediate representation, such as contours, palettes, and detailed textures, ultimately culminating in a high-quality RGB image. Instead of relying on the naive LDM concatenation conditioning mechanism to connect the different stages together, we employ Schrödinger Bridge to determine the optimal transport between different modalities. Although employing a cascaded pipeline introduces more stages, which could lead to a more complex architecture, each stage is meticulously formulated for efficiency and accuracy, surpassing Stable-Diffusion (LDM) performance. Modality composition not only enhances overall performance but enables emerging proprieties such as consistent editing, interaction capabilities, high-level interpretability, and faster convergence and sampling rate. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including LSUN-Churches, ImageNet, CelebHQ, and LAION-Art, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. For instance, ToddlerDiffusion achieves notable efficiency, matching LDM performance on LSUN-Churches while operating 2× faster with a 3× smaller architecture.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="limited supervision"/><category term="reliability"/><category term="foundation"/><category term="robustness"/><category term="generalization"/><category term="deep-learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amaia Cardiel, Victor Besnier, Yuan Yin, Andrei Bursuc, Éloi Zablocki]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2025_iclr.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2025_iclr.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">valeo.ai at NeurIPS 2024</title><link href="https://valeoai.github.io//posts/2024-12-04-valeoai-at-neurips-2024/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="valeo.ai at NeurIPS 2024"/><published>2024-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://valeoai.github.io//posts/valeoai-at-neurips-2024</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://valeoai.github.io//posts/2024-12-04-valeoai-at-neurips-2024/"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://neurips.cc/">Neural Information Processing Systems Conference (NeurIPS)</a> is a major inter-disciplinary event that brings together researchers and practicioners in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, optimization, statistics, but also neuroscience, natural sciences, social sciences, etc. This year, at the thirty-eigth edition of NeurIPS, the <a href="../">valeo.ai</a> team will present 7 papers in the main conference.</p> <p>We will be happy to discuss more about these projects and ideas, and share our exciting ongoing research.

Our method is simple: given any pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model’s embedding. The resulting features are evaluated on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision, 5 from natural language processing, and 2 from audio. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also show that using FUNGI features can benefit linear classification and image retrieval, and that they significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, for example improving upon DINO by +17% for semantic segmentation — without any training.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="manipose-manifold-constrained-multi-hypothesis-3d-human-pose-estimation">ManiPose: Manifold-Constrained Multi-Hypothesis 3D Human Pose Estimation</h2> <h3 id="authors-cédric-rommel--victor-letzelter--nermin-samet--renaud-marlet---matthieu-cord--patrick-pérez--eduardo-valle">Authors: <a href="https://cedricrommel.github.io/">Cédric Rommel</a>    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YhTdZh8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Victor Letzelter</a>    <a href="https://nerminsamet.github.io/">Nermin Samet</a>    <a href="http://imagine.enpc.fr/~marletr/">Renaud Marlet</a>    <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a>    <a href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/">Patrick Pérez</a>    <a href="https://eduardovalle.com/">Eduardo Valle</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06386">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/cedricrommel/manipose">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/manipose/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>We propose ManiPose, a manifold-constrained multi-hypothesis model for human-pose 2D-to-3D lifting.

ManiPose addresses depth ambiguity by proposing multiple candidate 3D poses for each 2D input, each with its estimated plausibility. Unlike previous multi-hypothesis approaches, ManiPose forgoes generative models, greatly facilitating its training and usage. By constraining the outputs to lie on the human pose manifold, ManiPose guarantees the consistency of all hypothetical poses, in contrast to previous works. We showcase the performance of ManiPose on real-world datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models in pose consistency by a large margin while being very competitive on the MPJPE metric.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_manipose/ManiPose_teaser.png" alt="manipose_overview" height="90%" width="90%"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="annealed-multiple-choice-learning-overcoming-limitations-of-winner-takes-all-with-annealing">Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing</h2> <h3 id="authors-david-perera--victor-letzelter--théo-mariotte---adrien-cortés--mickael-chen--slim-essid--gaël-richard">Authors: <a href="https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/members/">David Perera</a>    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YhTdZh8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Victor Letzelter</a>    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q3HZFcwAAAAJ">Théo Mariotte </a>    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/c1adrien/">Adrien Cortés</a>    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickael-chen-ml/">Mickael Chen</a>    <a href="https://slimessid.github.io/research/">Slim Essid</a>    <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/gael-richard">Gaël Richard</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15580">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/Victorletzelter/annealed_mcl">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/annealing/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_annealing/amcl_gif.gif" alt="annealing_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="geps-boosting-generalization-in-parametric-pde-neural-solvers-through-adaptive-conditioning">GEPS: Boosting Generalization in Parametric PDE Neural Solvers through Adaptive Conditioning</h2> <h3 id="authors-armand-kassaï-koupaï--jorge-mifsut-benet--yuan-yin--jean-noël-vittaut--patrick-gallinari">Authors: <a href="https://itsakk.github.io/">Armand Kassaï Koupaï</a>    <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/mifsutbenet/">Jorge Mifsut-Benet</a>    <a href="https://yuan-yin.github.io">Yuan Yin</a>    <a href="https://webia.lip6.fr/~vittaut/">Jean-Noël Vittaut</a>    <a href="https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/">Patrick Gallinari</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23889">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/itsakk/geps">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/geps/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges for data-driven methods due to the sensitivity of spatio-temporal dynamics to variations in PDE parameters. Machine learning approaches often struggle to capture this variability. To address this, data-driven approaches learn parametric PDEs by sampling a very large variety of trajectories with varying PDE parameters. We first show that incorporating conditioning mechanisms for learning parametric PDEs is essential and that among them, \textit{adaptive conditioning}, allows stronger generalization. As existing adaptive conditioning methods do not scale well with respect to the number of PDE parameters, we propose GEPS, a simple adaptation mechanism to boost GEneralization in Pde Solvers via a first-order optimization and low-rank rapid adaptation of a small set of context parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach for both fully data-driven and for physics-aware neural solvers. Validation performed on a whole range of spatio-temporal forecasting problems demonstrates excellent performance for generalizing to unseen conditions including initial conditions, PDE coefficients, forcing terms and solution domain.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_geps/geps.png" alt="geps_example" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="a-concept-based-explainability-framework-for-large-multimodal-models">A Concept-Based Explainability Framework for Large Multimodal Models</h2> <h3 id="authors-jayneel-parekh--pegah-khayatan--mustafa-shukor--alasdair-newson--matthieu-cord">Authors: <a href="https://jayneelparekh.github.io/">Jayneel Parekh</a>    <a href="https://pegah-kh.github.io/">Pegah Khayatan</a>    <a href="https://mustafashukor.github.io/">Mustafa Shukor</a>    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/alasdairnewson/">Alasdair Newson</a>    <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08074">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/mshukor/xl-vlms">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://jayneelparekh.github.io/LMM_Concept_Explainability/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks.

In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as “multi-modal concepts”. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_neurips/concept_xai.PNG" alt="concept_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="diffcut-catalyzing-zero-shot-semantic-segmentation-with-diffusion-features-and-recursive-normalized-cut">DiffCut: Catalyzing Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation with Diffusion Features and Recursive Normalized Cut</h2> <h3 id="authors-paul-couairon--mustafa-shukor--jean-emmanuel-haugeard--matthieu-cord--nicolas-thomea">Authors: <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=yQRnP7YAAAAJ">Paul Couairon</a>    <a href="https://mustafashukor.github.io/">Mustafa Shukor</a>    <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/92/6849.html">Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard</a>    <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a>    <a href="https://thome.isir.upmc.fr/">Nicolas Thome/a&gt;</a></h3> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02842">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/PaulCouairon/DiffCut">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://diffcut-segmentation.github.io/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details.

They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success. In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs. Findings. Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist. Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights. Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize. This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture. Implications. (1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection. (2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. (3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost. (4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_neurips/ima_llm.PNG" alt="implicit_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="3d perception"/><category term="multi-sensor"/><category term="limited supervision"/><category term="reliability"/><category term="motion forecasting"/><category term="robustness"/><category term="generalization"/><category term="driving"/><category term="deep-learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Victor Letzelter, Nermin Samet, Yuan Yin, Andrei Bursuc, Éloi Zablocki]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2023_neurips/logo_neurips.svg"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2023_neurips/logo_neurips.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">valeo.ai at ECCV 2024</title><link href="https://valeoai.github.io//posts/2024-09-25-valeoai-at-eccv-2024/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="valeo.ai at ECCV 2024"/><published>2024-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://valeoai.github.io//posts/valeoai-at-eccv-2024</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://valeoai.github.io//posts/2024-09-25-valeoai-at-eccv-2024/"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://eccv.ecva.net/">European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)</a> is a biennial landmark conference for the increasingly large community of researchers in computer vision and machine learning from both academia and industry.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_unitraj/unitraj.PNG" alt="unitraj_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Overview of UniTraj: a unified platform for comprehensive research in trajectory prediction.</b> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="lost-and-found-overcoming-detector-failures-in-online-multi-object-tracking">Lost and Found: Overcoming Detector Failures in Online Multi-Object Tracking</h2> <h4 id="authors-lorenzo-vaquero--yihong-xu--xavier-alameda-pineda--víctor-m-brea--manuel-mucientes">Authors: <a href="https://citius.gal/team/lorenzo-vaquero-otal/">Lorenzo Vaquero</a>    <a href="https://github.com/yihongXU">Yihong Xu</a>    <a href="https://xavirema.eu/">Xavier Alameda-Pineda</a>    <a href="https://citius.gal/team/victor-manuel-brea-sanchez/">Víctor M.

The prevailing approach, tracking-by-detection (TbD), first detects objects and then links detections, resulting in a simple yet effective method. However, contemporary detectors may occasionally miss some objects in certain frames, causing trackers to cease tracking prematurely. To tackle this issue, we propose BUSCA, meaning ‘to search’, a versatile framework compatible with any online TbD system, enhancing its ability to persistently track those objects missed by the detector, primarily due to occlusions. Remarkably, this is accomplished without modifying past tracking results or accessing future frames, i.e., in a fully online manner. BUSCA generates proposals based on neighboring tracks, motion, and learned tokens. Utilizing a decision Transformer that integrates multimodal visual and spatiotemporal information, it addresses the object-proposal association as a multi-choice question-answering task. BUSCA is trained independently of the underlying tracker, solely on synthetic data, without requiring fine-tuning. Through BUSCA, we showcase consistent performance enhancements across five different trackers and establish a new state-of-the-art baseline across three different benchmarks.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_busca/busca.png" alt="busca_overview" height="90%" width="90%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Overview of BUSCA</b>: Enhancing multi-object trackers by finding undetected objects. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="clip-dinoiser-teaching-clip-a-few-dino-tricks-for-open-vocabulary-semantic-segmentation">CLIP-DINOiser: Teaching CLIP a few DINO tricks for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation</h2> <h4 id="authors-monika-wysoczańska-oriane-siméoni--michaël-ramamonjisoa-andrei-bursuc-tomasz-trzciński--patrick-pérez">Authors: <a href="https://wysoczanska.github.io/">Monika Wysoczańska</a>  <a href="https://osimeoni.github.io/">Oriane Siméoni</a>   <a href="https://michaelramamonjisoa.github.io/">Michaël Ramamonjisoa</a>  <a href="https://abursuc.github.io/">Andrei Bursuc</a>  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=bJMRBFoAAAAJ">Tomasz Trzciński</a>   <a href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/">Patrick Pérez</a></h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12359">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/wysoczanska/clip_dinoiser/">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://wysoczanska.github.io/CLIP_DINOiser/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>The popular CLIP model displays impressive zero-shot capabilities thanks to its seamless interaction with arbitrary text prompts. However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_dinoiser/dinoiser-examples.png" alt="dinoiser_example" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Examples of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation results obtained with our method CLIP-DINOiser on ‘in-the-wild’ images vs. those of MaskCLIP.</b> </div> <p>We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are computed with a simple modification of CLIP’s last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features from DINO.

Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2024_eccv/dinoiser_overview.PNG" alt="dinoiser_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Overview of CLIP-DINOiser.</b> We use DINO as a teacher which ‘teaches’ CLIP how to extract localization information with similar patch correlations.

By fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, we perform zero-shot generation of synthetic data in OOD domains or inpainted with OOD objects. Synthetic data is employed to provide an initial assessment of pretrained segmenters, thereby offering insights into their performance when confronted with real edge cases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate a high correlation between the performance on synthetic data and the performance on real OOD data, showing the validity approach.

In end-to-end forecasting, the model must jointly detect from sensor data (cameras or LiDARs) the position and past trajectories of the different elements of the scene and predict their future location. We depart from the current trend of tackling this task via end-to-end training from perception to forecasting and we use a modular approach instead. Following a recent study, we individually build and train detection, tracking, and forecasting modules. We then only use consecutive finetuning steps to integrate the modules better and alleviate compounding errors. Our study reveals that this simple yet effective approach significantly improves performance on the end-to-end forecasting benchmark. Consequently, our solution ranks first in the Argoverse 2 end-to-end Forecasting Challenge held at CVPR 2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD), with 63.82 mAPf. We surpass forecasting results by +17.1 points over last year’s winner and by +13.3 points over this year’s runner-up. This remarkable performance in forecasting can be explained by our modular paradigm, which integrates finetuning strategies and significantly outperforms the end-to-end-trained counterparts.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_valeo4cast/valeo4cast.PNG" alt="valeo4cast_overview" height="80%" width="80%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Valeo4Cast overview.</b> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="pafuse-part-based-diffusion-for-3d-whole-body-pose-estimation">PAFUSE: Part-based Diffusion for 3D Whole-Body Pose Estimation</h2> <p class="page-description"><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/t-cap-2024/home">ECCV 2024 Workshop Towards a Complete Analysis of People (T-CAP)</a></p> <h4 id="authors-nermin-samet--cédric-rommel--david-picard--eduardo-valle">Authors: <a href="https://nerminsamet.github.io/">Nermin Samet</a>    <a href="https://cedricrommel.github.io/">Cédric Rommel</a>    <a href="https://davidpicard.github.io/">David Picard</a>    <a href="https://eduardovalle.com/">Eduardo Valle</a></h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10220">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/valeoai/PAFUSE">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/pafuse">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>We introduce a novel approach for 3D whole-body pose estimation, addressing the challenge of scale- and deformability- variance across body parts brought by the challenge of extending the 17 major joints on the human body to fine-grained keypoints on the face and hands.

Yet, fine-tuning VLMs comes with strong limitations as it requires a ‘white-box’ access to the model’s architecture and weights while some recent models are proprietary (e.g., Grounding DINO 1.5). It also requires expertise to design the fine-tuning objectives and optimize the hyper-parameters, which are specific to each VLM and downstream task. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a novel approach to adapt VLMs in a ‘black-box’ and semantic-aware manner by leveraging large language models (LLMs) so as to reason on their outputs.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_llm_wrapper/llm_wrapper.PNG" alt="llm-wrapper_overview" height="80%" width="80%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Overview of LLM-Wrapper.</b> </div> <p>We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-wrapper on Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), a challenging open-vocabulary task that requires spatial and semantic reasoning.

While increasing real-world training data coverage could address this issue, it is costly and dangerous. This work explores generating safety-critical driving scenarios by modifying complex real-world regular scenarios through trajectory optimization. We propose ReGentS, which stabilizes generated trajectories and introduces heuristics to avoid obvious collisions and optimization problems. Our approach addresses unrealistic diverging trajectories and unavoidable collision scenarios that are not useful for training robust planner. We also extend the scenario generation framework to handle real-world data with up to 32 agents. Additionally, by using a differentiable simulator, our approach simplifies gradient descent-based optimization involving a simulator, paving the way for future advancements.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_regents/regents_page.png" alt="regents_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-bravo-semantic-segmentation-challenge-results-in-uncv2024">The BRAVO Semantic Segmentation Challenge Results in UNCV2024</h2> <p class="page-description"><a href="https://uncertainty-cv.github.io/2024/challenge/">ECCV 2024 Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification for Computer Vision</a></p> <h4 id="authors-tuan-hung-vu---eduardo-valle--andrei-bursuc--tommie-kerssies--daan-de-geus--gijs-dubbelman--long-qian--bingke-zhu--yingying-chen--ming-tang--jinqiao-wang--tomáš-vojíř--jan-šochman--jiří-matas--michael-smith--frank-ferrie--shamik-basu--christos-sakaridis--luc-van-gool">Authors: <a href="https://tuanhungvu.github.io/">Tuan-Hung Vu</a>    <a href="https://eduardovalle.com/">Eduardo Valle</a>    <a href="https://abursuc.github.io/">Andrei Bursuc</a>    <a href="">Tommie Kerssies</a>    <a href="">Daan de Geus</a>    <a href="">Gijs Dubbelman</a>    <a href="">Long Qian</a>    <a href="">Bingke Zhu</a>    <a href="">Yingying Chen</a>    <a href="">Ming Tang</a>    <a href="">Jinqiao Wang</a>    <a href="">Tomáš Vojíř</a>    <a href="">Jan Šochman</a>    <a href="">Jiří Matas</a>    <a href="">Michael Smith</a>    <a href="">Frank Ferrie</a>    <a href="">Shamik Basu</a>    <a href="">Christos Sakaridis</a>    <a href="">Luc Van Gool</a></h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15107">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/valeoai/bravo_challenge">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://benchmarks.elsa-ai.eu/?ch=1&amp;com=introduction">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>We propose the unified BRAVO challenge to benchmark the reliability of semantic segmentation models under realistic perturbations and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

Ideally, 3D backbones for lidar should be able to inherit these properties after distillation of these powerful 2D features. The most recent methods for image-to-lidar distillation on autonomous driving data show promising results, obtained thanks to distillation methods that keep improving. Yet, we still notice a large performance gap when measuring by linear probing the quality of distilled vs fully supervised features.</p> <p>In this work, instead of focusing only on the distillation method, we study the effect of three pillars for distillation: the 3D backbone, the pretrained 2D backbone, and the pretraining 2D+3D dataset. In particular, thanks to our scalable distillation method named ScaLR, we show that scaling the 2D and 3D backbones and pretraining on diverse datasets leads to a substantial improvement of the feature quality. This allows us to significantly reduce the gap between the quality of distilled and fully-supervised 3D features, and to improve the robustness of the pretrained backbones to domain gaps and perturbations. We show that scaling the 2D and 3D backbones, and pretraining on diverse datasets leads to considerable improvements of the feature quality. The role of these pillars is actually more important than the distillation method itself, which we simplify for easier scaling.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2024_cvpr/scalr_overview.PNG" alt="scalr_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>ScaLR image-to-lidar distillation method with the three pillars studied in this work.</b> </div> <p>In this work, after proposing and studying a scalable distillation method, which we call ScaLR for Scalable Lidar Representation (see Figure above), we make the following contributions.</p> <p>First, we are able to significantly reduce the gap between distilled and supervised lidar representations: on nuScenes, we increase the performance by 22.8 mIoU percentage points compared to the former best distillation method.</p> <p>Second, we show it is possible to pretrain a single backbone on a mixture of datasets, performing similarly or better than separate backbones specialized on each dataset individually.

However, conventional models use grids with fixed resolution and range and face computational inefficiencies due to the uniform allocation of resources across all cells. To address this, we propose PointBeV, a novel sparse BeV segmentation model operating on sparse BeV cells instead of dense grids. This approach offers precise control over memory usage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and accommodating memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass strategy for training, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference time, it can be used with various memory/performance trade-offs and flexibly adjusts to new specific use cases.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_pointbev/pointbev.PNG" alt="pointbev_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>PointBeV overview.</b> As a sparse method, PointBeV is trained using local predictions, only for sampled 2D points provided as inputs.

However, in many real-world scenarios, conditional information may be noisy or unreliable due to human annotation errors or weak alignment. In this paper, we propose the Coherence-Aware Diffusion (CAD), a novel method that integrates coherence in conditional information into diffusion models, allowing them to learn from noisy annotations without discarding data. We assume that each data point has an associated coherence score that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then condition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the coherence score. In this way, the model learns to ignore or discount the conditioning when the coherence is low. We show that CAD is theoretically sound and empirically effective on various conditional generation tasks. Moreover, we show that leveraging coherence generates realistic and diverse samples that respect conditional information better than models trained on cleaned datasets where samples with low coherence have been discarded.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_dont_drop/teaser.png" alt="dont_drop_overview" height="90%" width="90%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Overview of Don't Drop your Samples.</b> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="supervised-anomaly-detection-for-complex-industrial-images">Supervised Anomaly Detection for Complex Industrial Images</h2> <h4 id="authors--aimira-baitieva--david-hurych--victor-besnier--olivier-bernard">Authors: <a href=""> Aimira Baitieva </a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XY1PVwYAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr&amp;oi=ao">David Hurych</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&amp;user=n_C2h-QAAAAJ">Victor Besnier</a>, <a href="">Olivier Bernard</a></h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04953">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/abc-125/segad">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://valeoai.github.io/publications/segad/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>Automating visual inspection in industrial production lines is essential for increasing product quality across various industries.

To address this challenge, we present (1) the Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD), a novel real-world industrial dataset comprising 5000 images, including 2000 instances of challenging real defects across more than 20 subclasses. Acknowledging that traditional AD methods struggle with this dataset, we introduce (2) Segmentation based Anomaly Detector (SegAD). First, SegAD leverages anomaly maps as well as segmentation maps to compute local statistics. Next, SegAD uses these statistics and an optional supervised classifier score as input features for a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) classifier, yielding the final anomaly score.

Existing generalization techniques necessitate substantial data augmentation, potentially sourced from external datasets, and aim at learning invariant representations by imposing various alignment constraints. Large-scale pretraining has recently shown promising generalization capabilities, along with the potential of bridging different modalities. For instance, the recent advent of vision-language models like CLIP has opened the doorway for vision models to exploit the textual modality. In this paper, we introduce a simple framework for generalizing semantic segmentation networks by employing language as the source of randomization. Our recipe comprises three key ingredients: i) the preservation of the intrinsic CLIP robustness through minimal fine-tuning, ii) language-driven local style augmentation, and iii) randomization by locally mixing the source and augmented styles during training. Extensive experiments report state-of-the-art results on various generalization benchmarks.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_famix/famix-overview.png" alt="famix_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Overall process of FAMix.</b> FAMix consists of two steps.

(Right) Training the segmentation network is performed with minimal fine-tuning of the backbone. At each iteration, the low-level feature activations are viewed as grids of patches. For each patch, the dominant class is queried using the ground truth, then a style is sampled from the corresponding style bank. Style randomization is performed by normalizing each patch in the grid by its statistics, and transferring the new style which is a mixing between the original style and the sampled one.

To address this challenge, we introduce the Adaptable Bayesian Neural Network (ABNN), a simple and scalable strategy to seamlessly transform DNNs into BNNs in a post-hoc manner with minimal computational and training overheads. ABNN preserves the main predictive properties of DNNs while enhancing their uncertainty quantification abilities through simple BNN adaptation layers (attached to normalization layers) and a few fine-tuning steps on pre-trained models.

NOPE also predicts 3D pose distribution which can be used to address pose ambiguities due to symmetries.</p> <p>The practicality of 3D object pose estimation remains limited for many applications due to the need for prior knowledge of a 3D model and a training period for new objects. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that takes a single image of a new object as input and predicts the relative pose of this object in new images without prior knowledge of the object’s 3D model and without requiring training time for new objects and categories. We achieve this by training a model to directly predict discriminative embeddings for viewpoints surrounding the object. This prediction is done using a simple U-Net architecture with attention and conditioned on the desired pose, which yields extremely fast inference.

In end-to-end forecasting, the model must jointly detect from sensor data (cameras or LiDARs) the position and past trajectories of the different elements of the scene and predict their future location. We depart from the current trend of tackling this task via end-to-end training from perception to forecasting and we use a modular approach instead. Following a recent study, we individually build and train detection, tracking, and forecasting modules. We then only use consecutive finetuning steps to integrate the modules better and alleviate compounding errors. Our study reveals that this simple yet effective approach significantly improves performance on the end-to-end forecasting benchmark. Consequently, our solution ranks first in the Argoverse 2 end-to-end Forecasting Challenge held at CVPR 2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD), with 63.82 mAPf.

Moreover, we identify several biases and limitations of M-ICL that warrant consideration prior to deployment.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/publications/2024_multimodal_icl/multimodal-icl.PNG" alt="icl_overview" height="60%" width="60%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Empirical analysis of Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL) behavior.</b> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="3d perception"/><category term="multi-sensor"/><category term="limited supervision"/><category term="reliability"/><category term="motion forecasting"/><category term="driving"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gilles Puy, Loïck Chambon, Victor Besnier, Sophia Sirko-Galouchenko, Spyros Gidaris, Alexandre Boulch, Renaud Marlet, Andrei Bursuc, Éloi Zablocki]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2024_cvpr/cvpr_banner.PNG"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2024_cvpr/cvpr_banner.PNG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">valeo.ai at NeurIPS 2023</title><link href="https://valeoai.github.io//posts/neurips-2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="valeo.ai at NeurIPS 2023"/><published>2023-12-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://valeoai.github.io//posts/valeoai-at-neurips-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://valeoai.github.io//posts/neurips-2023"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://neurips.cc/">Neural Information Processing Systems Conference (NeurIPS)</a> is a major inter-disciplinary event that brings together researchers and practicioners in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, optimization, statistics, but also neuroscience, natural sciences, social sciences, etc. This year, at the thirty-seventh edition of NeurIPS, the <a href="../">valeo.ai</a> team will present 4 papers in the main conference and 1 in the workshops.</p> <p>Notably, we explore perception via different sensors, e.g., audio, on the path towards increasingly autonomous systems.

Reinforcement learning, notably from human feedback (RLHF), can further align the network with the intended usage. Yet the imperfections in the proxy reward may hinder the training and lead to suboptimal results; the diversity of objectives in real-world tasks and human opinions exacerbate the issue. This paper proposes embracing the heterogeneity of diverse rewards by following a multi-policy strategy. Rather than focusing on a single a priori reward, we aim for Pareto-optimal generalization across the entire space of preferences. To this end, we propose rewarded soup, first specializing multiple networks independently (one for each proxy reward) and then interpolating their weights linearly. This succeeds empirically because we show that the weights remain linearly connected when fine-tuned on diverse rewards from a shared pre-trained initialization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for text-to-text (summarization, Q&amp;A, helpful assistant, review), text-image (image captioning, text-to-image generation, visual grounding, VQA), and control (locomotion) tasks. We hope to enhance the alignment of deep models, and how they interact with the world in all its diversity.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_neurips/rewarded-soups.png" alt="rs_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Illustration of the different steps of our proposed rewarded soup (RS).</b> After unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, we launch $N$ independent RL fine-tunings on the proxy rewards $\{R_i\}^{N}_{i=1}$.

Sparse convolutions have become a de-facto tool to process these large outdoor point clouds. The top performing methods on public benchmarks, such SemanticKITTI or nuScenes, all leverage sparse convolutions. Nevertheless, despite their undeniable success and efficiency, these convolutions remain available in a limited number of deep learning frameworks and hardware platforms. In this work, we propose an alternative backbone built with tools broadly available (such as 2D and 1D convolutions) but that still reaches the level of performance of the top methods on automotive datasets.</p> <p>We propose a point-based backbone, called WaffleIron, which is essentially built using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, both readily available in all deep learning frameworks thanks to their wide use in the field of computer vision. The architecture of this backbone is illustrated in the figure below. It is inspired by the recent MLP-Mixer. It takes as input a point cloud with a token associated to each point. All these point tokens are then updated by a sequence of layers, each containing a token-mixing step (made of dense 2D convolutions) and a channel-mixing step (made of a MLP shared across points).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_iccv/waffleiron.png" alt="waffle_overview" height="70%" width="70%"/></p> <div class="caption">The WaffleIron backbone takes as input point tokens, provided by an embedding layer (not represented), and updates these point representations L times via a point token-mixing layer (containing the WI block) followed by a channel-mixing layer. The WI block consists of a 2D projection along one of the main axes, a feed-forward network (FFN) with two dense channel-wise 2D convolutions with a ReLU activation in the hidden layer, and a simple copy of the 2D features to the 3D points. The channel-mixing layer contains a batch-norm, a MLP shared across each point, and a residual connection. The WaffleIron backbone is free of any point downsampling or upsampling layer, farthest point sampling, nearest neighbor search, or sparse convolution. </div> <p>WaffleIron has three main hyperparameters to tune: the depth L, the width F and the resolution of the 2D grid. We show that these parameters are easy to tune: the performance increases with the network width F and depth L, until an eventual saturation; we observe stable results over a wide range of values for the resolution of the 2D grid.</p> <p>In our paper, we also provide many details on how to train WaffleIron to reach the performance of top-entries on two autonomous driving benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="pøda-prompt-driven-zero-shot-domain-adaptation">PØDA: Prompt-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation</h2> <h4 id="authors-mohammad-fahes-tuan-hung-vu-andrei-bursuc-patrick-pérez-raoul-de-charette">Authors: Mohammad Fahes, Tuan-Hung Vu, Andrei Bursuc, Patrick Pérez, Raoul de Charette</h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03241">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/astra-vision/PODA">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kataxQoPuSE">Video</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://astra-vision.github.io/PODA/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p>Domain adaptation has been vastly investigated in computer vision but still requires access to target images at train time, which might be intractable in some uncommon conditions. In this paper, we propose the task of ‘Prompt-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation’, where we adapt a model trained on a source domain using only a general description in natural language of the target domain, i.e., a prompt. First, we leverage a pre-trained contrastive vision-language model (CLIP) to optimize affine transformations of source features, steering them towards the target text embedding while preserving their content and semantics. To achieve this, we propose Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). Second, we show that these prompt-driven augmentations can be used to perform zero-shot domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms CLIP-based style transfer baselines on several datasets for the downstream task at hand, even surpassing one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation.

Active Learning (AL) iteratively selects relevant data fractions to annotate within a given budget, but requires a first fraction of the dataset (a ’seed’) to be already annotated to estimate the benefit of annotating other data fractions. We show that the choice of the seed can significantly affect the performance of many AL methods and propose a method, named SeedAL, for automatically constructing a seed that will ensure good performance for AL. Assuming that images of the point clouds are available, which is common, our method relies on powerful unsupervised image features to measure the diversity of the point clouds. It selects the point clouds for the seed by optimizing the diversity under an annotation budget, which can be done by solving a linear optimization problem. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to random seeding and existing methods on both the S3DIS and SemanticKitti datasets.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_iccv/seedal.png" alt="seedal_overview" height="70%" width="70%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Impact of active learning seed on performance. </b>We show the variability of results obtained with 20 different random seeds (blue dashed lines), within an initial annotation budget of 3% of the dataset, when using various active learning methods for 3D semantic segmentation of S3DIS.

However, its application to purely predictive tasks, such as 3D human pose estimation (3D-HPE), remains largely unexplored. While a few pioneering works have shown promising performance metrics in 3D-HPE, the understanding of the benefits of diffusion models over classical supervision — as well as key design choices — is still in its infancy.

To do so, it requires solving mapping, detection, tracking, and then forecasting problems, in a multi-step pipeline. In this complex system, advances in conventional forecasting methods have been made using curated data, i.e., with the assumption of perfect maps, detection, and tracking. This paradigm, however, ignores any errors from upstream modules. Meanwhile, an emerging end-to-end paradigm, that tightly integrates the perception and forecasting architectures into joint training, promises to solve this issue. So far, however, the evaluation protocols between the two methods were incompatible and their comparison was not possible. In fact, and perhaps surprisingly, conventional forecasting methods are usually not trained nor tested in real-world pipelines (e.g., with upstream detection, tracking, and mapping modules). In this work, we aim to bring forecasting models closer to real-world deployment. First, we propose a unified evaluation pipeline for forecasting methods with real-world perception inputs, allowing us to compare the performance of conventional and end-to-end methods for the first time. Second, our in-depth study uncovers a substantial performance gap when transitioning from curated to perception-based data. In particular, we show that this gap (1) stems not only from differences in precision but also from the nature of imperfect inputs provided by perception modules, and that (2) is not trivially reduced by simply finetuning on perception outputs. Based on extensive experiments, we provide recommendations for critical areas that require improvement and guidance towards more robust motion forecasting in the real world. We will release an evaluation library to benchmark models under standardized and practical conditions.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_iccv/e2e_forecasting.png" alt="forecast_overview" height="90%" width="90%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Study overview.</b> We study the challenges of deploying motion forecasting models into the real world when only predicted perception inputs are available.

In the real-world setting, evaluation is challenging as the past tracks are estimated with arbitrary identities, making it difficult to establish a direct correspondence to GT identities. Therefore, we propose a matching process (purple) to assign predictions to GT and thus evaluate forecasting performances.

Among explanation methods, counterfactual explanations aim to find minimal and interpretable changes to the input image that would also change the output of the model to be explained. Such explanations point end-users at the main factors that impact the decision of the model. However, previous methods struggle to explain decision models trained on images with many objects, e.g., urban scenes, which are more difficult to work with but also arguably more critical to explain. In this work, we propose to tackle this issue with an object-centric framework for counterfactual explanation generation. Our method, inspired by recent generative modeling works, encodes the query image into a latent space that is structured in a way to ease object-level manipulations. Doing so, it provides the end-user with control over which search directions (e.g., spatial displacement of objects, style modification, etc.) are to be explored during the counterfactual generation. We conduct a set of experiments on counterfactual explanation benchmarks for driving scenes, and we show that our method can be adapted beyond classification, e.g., to explain semantic segmentation models. To complete our analysis, we design and run a user study that measures the usefulness of counterfactual explanations in understanding a decision model.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_cvpr/octet.png" alt="octet_overview" height="80%" width="80%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Counterfactual explanations generated by OCTET.</b> Given a classifier that predicts whether or not it is possible to go left, and a query image (top left), OCTET produces a counterfactual explanation where the most influential features that led to the decision are changed (top right).

The core idea is to train the model on a pretext task which is the reconstruction of the surface on which the 3D points are sampled, and to use the underlying latent vectors as input to the perception head. The intuition is that if the network is able to reconstruct the scene surface, given only sparse input points, then it probably also captures some fragments of semantic information that can be used to boost an actual perception task. This principle has a very simple formulation, which makes it both easy to implement and widely applicable to a large range of 3D sensors and deep networks performing semantic segmentation or object detection. In fact, it supports a single-stream pipeline, as opposed to most contrastive learning approaches, allowing training on limited resources. We conducted extensive experiments on various autonomous driving datasets, involving very different kinds of lidars, for both semantic segmentation and object detection. The results show the effectiveness of our method to learn useful representations without any annotation, compared to existing approaches.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_cvpr/also.png" alt="also_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>ALSO overview.</b> The backbone to pre-train produces latent vectors for each input point.

However, discovering objects in an image with no supervision is a very hard task; what are the desired objects, when to separate them into parts, how many are there, and of what classes? The answers to these questions depend on the tasks and datasets of evaluation. In this work, we take a different approach and propose to look for the background instead. This way, the salient objects emerge as a by-product without any strong assumption on what an object should be. We propose FOUND, a simple model made of a single conv1 × 1 initialized with coarse background masks extracted from self-supervised patch-based representations. After fast training and refining these seed masks, the model reaches state-of-the-art results on unsupervised saliency detection and object discovery benchmarks.

A common approach to segment large scale LiDAR point clouds is to project the points on a 2D surface and then to use regular CNNs, originally designed for images, to process the projected point clouds. These projection-based methods usually benefit from fast computations and, when combined with techniques which use other point cloud representations, achieve state-of-the-art results.</p> <p>Today, projection-based methods leverage 2D CNNs but recent advances in computer vision show that vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many image-based benchmarks. Despite the absence of almost any domain-specific inductive bias apart from the image tokenization process, ViTs have a strong representation learning capacity and achieve excellent results on various image perception tasks, such as image classification, object detection or semantic segmentation. Inspired by this success of ViTs for image understanding, in this work, we show that projection-based methods for 3D semantic segmentation can benefit from these latest improvements on ViTs when combined with three key ingredients, all described in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10222">paper</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_cvpr/rangevit-teaser.png" alt="rangevit_teaser" height="75%" width="75%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Exploiting vision transformer (ViT) architectures and weights for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation.</b> We leverage the flexibility of transformer-based architectures to re-purpose them with minimal changes for processing sparse point clouds in autonomous driving tasks.

By preserving the same backbone architecture as for RGB images, we can exploit the knowledge from long training on large image collections that are much cheaper to acquire and annotate than point clouds. We reach our best results with pre-trained ViTs on large image datasets. (b) We compensate for ViTs’ lack of inductive bias by substituting a tailored non-linear convolutional stem for the classical linear embedding layer. (c) We refine pixel-wise predictions with a convolutional decoder and a skip connection from the convolutional stem to combine low-level but fine-grained features of the convolutional stem with the high-level but coarse predictions of the ViT encoder. With these ingredients, we show that our method, called RangeViT, outperforms prior projection-based methods on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2023_cvpr/rangevit-overview.png" alt="rangevit_overview" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b> Overview of RangeViT architecture.</b> First, the point cloud is projected in a 2D space with range projection.

In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16258">Image-to-Lidar Self-Supervised Distillation for Autonomous Driving Data</a>, we propose a self-supervised pre-training method for 3D perception models that is tailored to autonomous driving data and that does not require any annotation.

Recent progress toward High Definition (HD) Imaging radars has driven the angular resolution below the degree, thus approaching laser scanning performance. However, the amount of data a HD radar delivers and the computational cost to estimate the angular positions remain a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel HD radar sensing model, FFT-RadNet, that eliminates the overhead of computing the range-azimuth-Doppler 3D tensor, learning instead to recover angles from a range-Doppler spectrum. This architecture can be leveraged for various perception tasks with raw HD radar signals. In particular we show how to train FFT-RadNet both to detect vehicles and to segment free driving space. On both tasks, it competes with the most recent radar-based models while requiring less compute and memory.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2022_cvpr/radial_overview.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption">Overview of FFT-RadNet for vehicle detection and drivable space segmentation in raw HD radar signal.</div> <p>Also, and importantly, we collected and annotated 2-hour worth of raw data from synchronized automotive-grade sensors (camera, laser, HD radar) in various environments (city street, highway, countryside road).

However, many of them face scalability issues as they encode the isosurface function of a whole object or scene into a single latent vector. To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they lose the direct connection with the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization tuning.</p> <p>In POCO, we propose to use point cloud convolution and compute a latent vector at each input point. We then perform a learning-based interpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights. On the one hand, using a convolutional backbone allows the aggregation of global information about the shape needed to correctly orientate the surface (decide which side of the surface is inside or outside). On the other hand, surface location is inferred via a local attention-based approach which enables accurate surface positioning.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2022_cvpr/poco_teaser.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>POCO overview.</b> Top row: the decoding mechanism takes as input local latent vectors and local coordinates which are lifted with a point-wise MLP.

Through a dynamic expansion of special tokens, we specialize each forward of our decoder network on a task distribution. Our strategy scales to a large number of tasks while having negligible memory and time overheads due to strict control of the parameters expansion. Moreover, this efficient strategy does not need any hyperparameter tuning to control the network’s expansion. Our model reaches excellent results on CIFAR100 and state-of-the-art performances on the large-scale ImageNet100 and ImageNet1000 while having fewer parameters than concurrent dynamic frameworks.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2022_cvpr/dytox.png" alt="" height="85%" width="85%"/></p> <div class="caption"> DyTox transformer model.</div> <hr/> <h2 id="flexit-towards-flexible-semantic-image-translation">FlexIT: Towards Flexible Semantic Image Translation</h2> <h4 id="authors-guillaume-couairon-asya-grechka-jakob-verbeek-holger-schwenk-matthieu-cord">Authors: Guillaume Couairon, Asya Grechka, <a href="https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/verbeek/">Jakob Verbeek</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Ysjk8kkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Holger Schwenk</a>, <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a></h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04705">Paper</a>] </h4> <p>Deep generative models, like GANs, have considerably improved the state of the art in image synthesis, and are able to generate near photo-realistic images in structured domains such as human faces.

This setup reflects the real-life scenario where data are continuously acquired in different places at different times. In such a continual setup, we aim for learning with zero forgetting, i.e., with no degradation in synthesis quality over earlier domains due to catastrophic forgetting.

Automotive radars are low-cost active sensors that measure properties of surrounding objects, including their relative speed, and have the key advantage of not being impacted by rain, snow or fog and could effectively complement the other perception sensors mounted on the car, e.g., cameras, LIDAR. However, they are seldom used for scene understanding due to the size and complexity of radar raw data and the lack of annotated datasets.

Component modules of such systems frequently rely on powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), that however do not always generalize to objects unseen in the training data. Simple uncertainty estimation techniques, e.g., entropy of softmax predictions, are less effective since modern DNNs are consistently overconfident on both in-domain and out-of-distribution (OOD) data samples. This hinders further the performance of downstream components relying on their predictions. Dealing successfully with the <em>“unknown unknown”</em>, e.g., by launching an alert or failing gracefully, is crucial.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2021_iccv/robot_hit.gif" alt="" height="50%" width="50%"/></p> <div class="caption">By making our target model to fail we can learn its behavior when failing and more reliably detect it at test time.</div> <p>In this work we take inspiration from practices in industrial validation, where the performance of a target model is tested in various extreme cases.

To this end we propose a new OOD detection architecture called ObsNet and an associated training scheme based on Local Adversarial Attacks (LAA). Finding failure modes in a trained DNN is quite challenging as such models typically achieve high accuracy, i.e., are rarely wrong, and corner-case samples are rather inserted in the training set than used for validation. LAA triggers failure modes in the target model that are a good proxy for failures in face of unknown OOD data. ObsNet achieves reliable detection of failure and OOD objects without compromising on predictive accuracy and computational time.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="multi-target-adversarial-frameworks-for-domain-adaptation-in-semantic-segmentation">Multi-Target Adversarial Frameworks for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation</h2> <h4 id="authors--antoine-saporta-tuan-hung-vu-matthieu-cord-patrick-pérez">Authors: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jSwfIU4AAAAJ">Antoine Saporta</a>, <a href="https://tuanhungvu.github.io/">Tuan-Hung Vu</a>, <a href="https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/">Matthieu Cord</a>, <a href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/">Patrick Pérez</a></h4> <h4 align="center"> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06962">Paper</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://github.com/valeoai/MTAF">Code</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="../publications/mtaf/">Project page</a>]</h4> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2021_iccv/mtaf_teaser.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/></p> <div class="caption"><b>Single-target unsupervised domain adaptation fails to produce models that perform on multiple target domains.</b> The aim of multi-target unsupervised domain adaptation is to train a model that excels on these multiple target domains.</div> <p>Autonomous vehicles rely on perception models that require a tremendous amount of annotated data to be trained in a supervised fashion. To reduce the reliance on manual annotation which can get extremely expensive when we consider semantic segmentation of urban scenes for instance, domain adaptation is a popular topic that leverages annotated data from a source domain to train a model on a target domain. More specifically, the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting only relies on unlabeled data from the target domain and aims at bridging the gap between target and source domains. Most UDA approaches tackle the alignment between a single source domain and a single target domain but don’t generalize well to more domains.

The most famous method to solve this task is ICP, but is mostly suited for small transformations. Several improvements have been made and the most recent techniques leverage deep learning.</p> <p>The typical pipeline for point cloud registration is <strong>(a)</strong> point matching followed by <strong>(b)</strong> point-pairs filtering to remove incorrect matches in, e.g., non-overlapping regions. One natural way to improve this pipeline is to use deep learning in step <strong>(a)</strong> to obtain point features of high quality and get pairs of matching points with a nearest neighbors search in this learned feature space. Then, one can typically rely on a classical RANSAC-based method in step <strong>(b)</strong>. Another category of methods exploits deep learning in step <strong>(a)</strong> and step <strong>(b)</strong>, as proposed by, e.g., DCP, PRNet, DGR. PCAM belongs to this second category where a first network outputs pairs of matching points and a second network filters incorrect pairs.</p> <p>We construct PCAM by observing that one needs two types of information to correctly match points between two point clouds. First, one needs local fine geometric information to precisely select the best corresponding point. Second, one also needs high-level contextual information to differentiate between points with similar local geometry but from different parts of the scene. Therefore, we compute point correspondences at every layer of our deep network via cross-attention matrices, and combine these matrices via a pointwise multiplication. This simple yet very effective solution naturally ensures that both low-level geometric and high-level context information are exploited when matching points. It also permits to remove spurious matches found only at one scale. Furthermore, these cross-attention matrices are also exploited to exchange information between the point clouds at each layer, allowing the network to use context information to find the best matching point within the overlapping regions.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> Arthur Ouaknine,&nbsp;Alasdair Newson,&nbsp;Julien Rebut,&nbsp;Florence Tupin,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Patrick Pérez.&nbsp; CARRADA Dataset: Camera and Automotive Radar with Range- Angle- Doppler Annotations.&nbsp; <em>In 2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</em>,&nbsp;2021. </div> </li></ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="domain adaptation"/><category term="3d perception"/><category term="reliability"/><category term="multi-sensor"/><category term="limited supervision"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andrei Bursuc, Gilles Puy, Arthur Ouaknine, Antoine Saporta]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2021_iccv/iccv_logo.png"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://valeoai.github.io//assets/img/posts/2021_iccv/iccv_logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry></feed>
