The [International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)](https://iccv.thecvf.com/) is a leading conference that brings together researchers and practitioners in computer vision and machine learning. At the 2025 edition, the [valeo.ai](../) team will present five papers in the main conference. We are also contributing to the **[Foundational Data for Industrial Tech Transfer](https://iccv2025-found-workshop.limitlab.xyz)** workshop with a keynote on [Towards openness of vision foundation models](https://iccv2025-found-workshop.limitlab.xyz/program).  
The team will be at ICCV to present these works, exchange ideas, and share our exciting ongoing research. We look forward to seeing you in Honolulu!
